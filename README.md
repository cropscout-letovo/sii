# CropScout. Start to Innovate submission

Python packages represent ROS2 nodes that power our drone control system.

## Compiling and launching the system

We use ROS2 Jazzy (for Ubuntu, since we use Raspberry Pi 5 as the flight controller on our drone) as an engine that allows our drone to efficiently function within a chosen modular structure.

### Prerequisites

- ROS ([installation manual](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html))
- MAVROS  

This is an [excellent tutorial on Habr](https://habr.com/ru/articles/768048) on installing and launching the sample ROS2 node. Following the same procedure, you can get our nodes up and running.

For your convenience, you may use [rqt Topic Viewer](https://wiki.ros.org/rqt/UserGuide) in addition to ROS2 core to see output of each of the nodes conforming to the MAVLINK protocol, essentially guiding the entire flight.

## Obstacle Avoidance Demo

Launch `control_system/obstacle_avoidance/forest_line_simulation.py`

It will connect to a mock drone controller responsible for obstacle avoidance and you will observe processed data from mock LIDAR in the module output.

## Web Interface (UI)

Source code for the web interface (FastAPI application) can be found under `web_interface` folder. Requirements are listed in the `requirements.lock` file.

Currently app functions in a demonstration mode, without a connection to the real drone flight controller â€“ however, this functionality can be toggled.

You can find more information about our interface in this video.
